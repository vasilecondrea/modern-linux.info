**Intro**

This is a repo containing my notes and code snippets taken while reading *Learning Modern Linux* by M. Hausenblas.

It all starts from a forked repo of M. Hausenblas which you can find here https://github.com/mhausenblas/modern-linux.info. 

My fork is of February 10, 2022 and does not update with the upstream repo after this date.

The folders *VAC-my-notes* and *VAC-code-snippets* contain my work on this repo. 

If you need to run the .sh files to see output, please do `bash [name-of.sh-file]`

I hope you enjoy this. Have a look around and I would welcome any comment you may have.
